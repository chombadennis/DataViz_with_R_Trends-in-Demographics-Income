Creating interactive dashboard with Shiny inR to explore census data to figure out what trends in different demographics I can find and tell the marketing team my findings.

The UCI Adult dataset is used to create a dashboard that gives insight on the following questions:

    Does education level impact the salary?
    Impact of age and sex on salary?
    People from which native countries are given less income in spite of having good education?
    Does number of hours working contribute to less income?
    Which workclass faces less income?
